Hi, I am Simon Stubben.
===================  
<br />
I'm a consultant, startup advisor and developer living in Kuala Lumpur.
I enjoy it here, because it's always hot and I have my girlfriend here.

You can find me on Twitter, Github, ...

I'm always up for a chat, so feel free to <a href="mailto:simonstubben@gmail.com?Subject=Hello.">email me</a> or book a time with me for a Skype meeting.
