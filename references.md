      Simon was hired as a technical consultant at BBD Labs (Malaysia) to help us quantify and improve our software development method.
      Simon immediately started - step-by-step - implementing the Scrum process.
      This was done by training the team in Scrum, adding methods and tools for task estimation and consumed hours, and task assurance and quality.
      The team was happy about the training received and it gave us, as managers, a great insights into where we could improve.
      We can definitely recommend Simon as a technical process consultant, not just due to his competencies but also as he is a very likable guy.<br>

    Simon was brought into a critical customer project when we're pressed for time delivering features in our Ruby on Rails based product.
    He absolutely hit the ground running and contributed from day one even though the product contains a good deal of ReactJS, which he did not have experience with at the time.
    He now manages the technical part of the project entirely and is very responsible about keeping the product stable and running

    Simon is great to work with - he brings a great spirit to the team and is very good at problem solving.
    He's also a great asset when translating user needs into working solutions.<br>
