Thanks for passing by; it is a pleasure to have you here.

This site will act as a professional blog, online business card, and reference to the projects that I take or have taken part in.

You will find more about me, what I do and have done in the [About section](/about/). In the [Consulting section](/consulting/), I have listed my interests and skill sets, how I can add value to your company or project, and of course my contact details.

For a new year, new times, and new paths -
Simon Stubben
